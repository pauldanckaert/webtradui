This is a test tree and supporting library for Tradui.

This now works with Firefox/Google Gears, Safari 4, and Google Chrome.  The last two are supported via HTML5 Web Databases, while the first of course is via Gears.  The index file contained here provides a simple example of using the underlying library, but is not a critical component here.  Note that the library is now async for all operations with the database, using callbacks to provide values as needed.

Please feel free to send requests for information and comments.
