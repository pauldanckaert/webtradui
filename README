This is a test tree and supporting library for Tradui.

This now works with Firefox/Google Gears, Safari 4, and Google Chrome.  The last two are supported via HTML5 Web Databases, while the first of course is via Gears.  The index file contained here provides a simple example of using the underlying library, but is not a critical component here.  Note that the library is now async for all operations with the database, using callbacks to provide values as needed.

This also now has a Microsoft Translation API integration using an AppId for Tradui, and a library namespace for realtime translation support.

Please feel free to send requests for information and comments.
